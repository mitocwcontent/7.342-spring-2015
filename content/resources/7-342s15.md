  caption: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are embryonic stem cells that
    can be derived from human skin cells. These iPS cells can then develop into different
    cell types. Image shows neural progenitors cells differentiated from human iPS
    cells. Red indicates a protein found in neural progenitors cells but not in pluripotent
    or skin cells. Blue indicates cell nuclei. Learn more about reprogramming in the
    Week 5 [Lecture Summaries](pages/lecture-summaries) and [Readings](pages/readings),
    and about neural differentiation in Week 6 [Lecture Summaries](pages/lecture-summaries)
    and [Readings](pages/readings). Image by Malkiel Cohen, used with permission.
